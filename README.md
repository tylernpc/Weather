# Weather Forecast
This is a(n) api driven weather service. HTML, CSS, and JS
The idea was to not use any api's that required a key

There's a lot of variability you can do here
(Weather API)
https://api.weather.gov/points/LATITUDE,LONGITUDE
(Location Finder API)
https://geocoder.ca/?locate=ADDRESS,+POSTALCODE&geoit=XML&json=1 
Something to note about the location finder is for the address it's imparative that you must format it with spaces with +
e.g.
Lincoln Nebraska State Capitol
1445 K St
1445+K+St
In this case the plus sign is a space
